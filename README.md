# Country Details App Completed with 2 pages and search bar

This is a simple web application that displays information about different countries. It consists of two pages: the Home page, which lists all countries with their flags and names, and the Detail page, which shows additional information about each country.

## Home Page

- **Description**: The Home page displays all countries along with their flags and names.
- **Fetch URL**: [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all)

## Detail Page

- **Description**: The Detail page provides detailed information about a specific country.
- **Fetch URL**: [https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{countryName}](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{countryName})

**Note:** Make sure to handle routing in your application using a library like React Router DOM to navigate between the Home and Detail pages.
